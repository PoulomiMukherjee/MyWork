Please find the list of data analyses that I have worked on mentioned below:

### [Logistic regression on lead-scoring data for an educational website company](https://github.com/PoulomiMukherjee/LeadScoringCaseStudy)

#### Highlights:

In this data analysis, the data from a company that has an educational website is taken. This dataset contains details of each and every potential lead that is generated by the company through multiple channels. The company wants to determine the chances that a customer will  get converted so as to take any necessary action. Using a logistic regression model, the leads are assigned a probability score for conversion and an optimum cut-off probability for conversion is determined.

### [PCA & clustering on country-wise socio-economic data for an NGO](https://github.com/PoulomiMukherjee/PCA_Clustering)

#### Highlights:

This data analysis is done for an NGO that is looking to send aid to some of the countries that need it the most using a dataset that contain the socio-economic details of the countries of the world. In order to determine which of the countries are in dire need of aid, the data is used to form clusters based on the socio-economic conditions while the behaviour of these clusters are observed to determine some of the top countries that should receive aid.

### [Advanced regression on Australian real estate data for a US-based company](https://github.com/PoulomiMukherjee/AdvancedRegression)

#### Highlights:

A US-based housing company wants to analyse the Australian real estate market in order to determine whether it should invest in a house by determining the top features that impact the house prices. Through this data analysis, two models are created using Ridge regression and Lasso regression using the house sale data to filter some of the variables that contribute to the prices of a house in the country.

### [Predictive analysis on churn data for a telecom company](https://github.com/PoulomiMukherjee/TelecomChurnCaseStudy)

#### Highlights:

For this analysis, the churn data of a telecom company for 4 months (June, July, August, and September) is taken. After analysing the data from the months of June, July, and August, different models are created to predict which high-value customers are more likely to churn. First, a model which has high interpretability is created in order to determine some of the key variables that are impacting the churn so as to suggest some business actions that can help bring the churn rate down. Next, 3 different models are generated which offer high accuracy to better predict the high-risk customers.

### [Stock market analysis on MySQL Workbench](https://github.com/PoulomiMukherjee/SQLCaseStudy)

#### Highlights:

The stock market data from 1 January 2015 to 31 July 2018 has been taken from the NSE website for analysis. In this dataset, the stock prices of 6 companies including TCS, Eicher Motors, Hero MotoCorp, TVS Motors, Bajaj Auto, and Infosys are present. Once the datasets are loaded in the server as a separate schema, the 20-day and 50-day moving averages of the stocks are calculated in order to check the market trend of the respective stocks. After that, based on the moving averages, a flag is generated which would indicate whether one should buy, sell, or hold the stock on the particular day.

### [Big data analysis (EDA) on New York taxi data using HiveQL](https://github.com/PoulomiMukherjee/HiveCaseStudy)

#### Highlights: 

Under this analysis, the data from a yellow taxi company operating in New York is taken to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the trips that were made between November 2017 and December 2017. A detailed EDA is performed on the data to see whether there are any non-conforming records present. The erroneous records are removed after making the appropriate assumptions. Next, the data is partitioned and an orc table is created to filter out the needed records easily. Then, further EDA is performed to answer a few exploratory questions.
